## Introduction

Net_Practice is a practical networking exercise designed to help you understand and configure small-scale networks. Through this project, you'll gain hands-on experience with TCP/IP addressing and network configuration. The project consists of 10 levels of increasing complexity, where you'll need to solve various networking problems to make the networks functional.

## Installation

Due to 42 licence for the exercice files, i can't share the file to you. Sorry !

## Quick start

1. Launch the interface by opening `index.html` in your web browser
2. Enter your login in the field for practice mode
   - Leave the field empty for correction mode
3. Start with Level 1 and progress through the exercises
4. Use the "Check again" button to verify your configuration
5. Export your configuration using "Get my config" after completing each level

## Mandatory part

The project consists of 10 levels of network configuration exercises. For each level:

1. A non-functioning network diagram will be presented
2. Modify the unshaded fields to create a working network configuration
3. Use the "Check again" button to verify your solution
4. Export your configuration using "Get my config" before proceeding to the next level
5. Review the logs at the bottom of the page for debugging information

Understanding TCP/IP addressing and router functionality is crucial for completing these exercises successfully.

## Known issues and limitations

- The networks in this project are simulated and not real networks
- The interface is web-based and requires a browser to function
- External tools are not allowed during evaluation, except for basic calculators like "bc"

## Submission and peer-evaluation

### Submission Requirements

1. Submit 10 configuration files (one for each level) in your Git repository
2. Files must be placed at the root of your repository
3. Each file should be exported using the "Get my config" button
4. Ensure your login was entered in the training interface

### Evaluation Process

- During defense, you will need to complete 3 random levels
- Time will be limited for completion
- Only a basic calculator (like "bc") is allowed during evaluation
- Only the work inside your repository will be evaluated
